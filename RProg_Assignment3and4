This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

Question 1:  Use the summarize() function to find the average calories across all cereals in the cereals dataset. I've included the starter code for you below!
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
# Load the cereal dataset
cereal_data <- read_csv('/Users/sabri/Downloads/cereal.csv', show_col_types=FALSE)

# Display the first few rows
head(cereal_data)

glimpse(cereal_data)

summarize(cereal_data, avg_calories = mean(calories))
```
Question 2: Use the summarize() function to find the largest sugar amount of any cereal in the cereals dataset. Hint: you will have to use max(sugars) as one argument to the summarize() function!
```{r}
summarize(cereal_data, max_sugar = max(sugars))
```

Question 3: Use the summarize() function to find out how many distinct cereal brands there are in this dataset. Hint: you will have to use n_distinct(mfr) as one argument to the summarize() function!
```{r}
summarize(cereal_data, num_brands = n_distinct(mfr))
```

Question 4: Use both filter() and summarize() to find the average calories of Kellogs brand (K) cereals. This one is a bit harder, but i'll provide the starter code for you. Remember that there are two steps we need to take!

The first is to filter() our dataset to only include Kellogs brand cereals

The second is to summarize() to find the average calories of the remaining rows.
```{r}
# First filter for only kellogs brand cereals then take average calories of remaining rows
filter(cereal_data, mfr == "K") |> summarize(avg_kellogs_cals = mean(calories))
```

Question 5: Use both group_by() and summarize() to find the average milligrams of sodium (sodium) of each cereal type. I've provided the starter code for you below!
```{r}
group_by(cereal_data, mfr) |> summarize(mean(sodium))
```
Question 6 (optional - advanced): Which brand has the highest calorie cold cereal?

Hint: This requires a filter(), a group_by(), a summarize(), and an optional arrange(). Remember that you can combine all these operations together with the pipe operator (|>).
```{r}
filter(cereal_data, type =="C") |> group_by(highcal_cold = calories) |> arrange(desc(highcal_cold))
```
Assignment 4_4
Question 1: What can you conclude from the visualization below? Write a short explanation (2-3 sentences) in the space provided below.
Answer: P or Post cereal appears to have the most sugar on average, while N or Nabisco cereal has the lowest amount of sugar on average. Most cereals have a lot of sugar!
```{r}
ggplot(cereal_data, aes(x = mfr, y = sugars)) + geom_bar(stat = 'summary', fun = 'mean') + 
  labs(title = "Average grams of sugar in cereals by brand") + 
  xlab("Manufacturer") +
  ylab("Avg. Sugar (grams)")
```
Question 2: What can you conclude from the visualization below? Write a short explanation (2-3 sentences) in the space provided below.
Answer: Most cereals or approximately 28 cereals have between 100 to 118 calories per serving. Cereals with 40 to 80 calories per serving are uncommon as well as cereals with 150 to 160 calories per serving
```{r}
ggplot(cereal_data, aes(x = calories)) + geom_histogram(bins=10) + 
  labs(title = "Histogram of Cereal Calories") + 
  xlab("Calories Per Serving") + 
  ylab("Count")
```
Question 3: What can you conclude from the visualization below? Write a short explanation (2-3 sentences) in the space provided below.
Answer:As sugar content goes up, consumer rating goes down. If the consumer rating were based off of people with a sweet tooth that might not be the case, like children for example.
```{r}
# Run this code and then make your conclusions
ggplot(cereal_data, aes(x = sugars, y = rating)) + geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, method = 'lm', formula = 'y ~ x') + 
  labs(title = "Scatter Plot of Sugar Content vs. Consumer Rating for 80 Cereals") + 
  xlab("Sugar Content (Grams)") + 
  ylab("Consumer Rating")
```
Question 4: Produce a scatter plot of sodium vs. rating where sodium is on the x axis and rating is on the y axis. Give the chart a suitable title using labs(title = "...")
```{r}
# Please fill in the blanks
ggplot(cereal_data, aes(x = sodium, y = rating)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(se = FALSE, method = 'lm', formula = 'y ~ x') +
  labs(title = "Saltiness to Rating") +
  xlab("Sodium Content (Grams)") + 
  ylab("Consumer Rating")
```
Question 5: Produce a bar chart that shows the number of cereals produced by each mfr. Give the chart a suitable title using labs(title = "...")

Hint: You will need to use geom_bar(stat = 'count')
```{r}
ggplot(cereal_data, aes(x = mfr)) + geom_bar(stat = "count") + 
  labs(title = "Bar Chart of Cereal Types") + 
  xlab("Calories Per Serving") + 
  ylab("Count")
```
Question 6: (optional - bonus)

Part 1: Generate a histogram of the sugars column. Hint: you will need to use the geom_histogram() function.
```{r}
ggplot(cereal_data, aes(x = sugars)) + geom_histogram(bins=10) + 
  labs(title = "Histogram of Cereal Sugars") + 
  xlab("Sugar Per Serving") + 
  ylab("Count")
```
