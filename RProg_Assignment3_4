This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

Question 1:  Use the summarize() function to find the average calories across all cereals in the cereals dataset. I've included the starter code for you below!
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
# Load the cereal dataset
cereal_data <- read_csv('/Users/sabri/Downloads/cereal.csv', show_col_types=FALSE)

# Display the first few rows
head(cereal_data)

glimpse(cereal_data)

summarize(cereal_data, avg_calories = mean(calories))
```
Question 2: Use the summarize() function to find the largest sugar amount of any cereal in the cereals dataset. Hint: you will have to use max(sugars) as one argument to the summarize() function!
```{r}
summarize(cereal_data, max_sugar = max(sugars))
```

Question 3: Use the summarize() function to find out how many distinct cereal brands there are in this dataset. Hint: you will have to use n_distinct(mfr) as one argument to the summarize() function!
```{r}
summarize(cereal_data, num_brands = n_distinct(mfr))
```

Question 4: Use both filter() and summarize() to find the average calories of Kellogs brand (K) cereals. This one is a bit harder, but i'll provide the starter code for you. Remember that there are two steps we need to take!

The first is to filter() our dataset to only include Kellogs brand cereals

The second is to summarize() to find the average calories of the remaining rows.
```{r}
# First filter for only kellogs brand cereals then take average calories of remaining rows
filter(cereal_data, mfr == "K") |> summarize(avg_kellogs_cals = mean(calories))
```

Question 5: Use both group_by() and summarize() to find the average milligrams of sodium (sodium) of each cereal type. I've provided the starter code for you below!
```{r}
group_by(cereal_data, mfr) |> summarize(mean(sodium))
```
Question 6 (optional - advanced): Which brand has the highest calorie cold cereal?

Hint: This requires a filter(), a group_by(), a summarize(), and an optional arrange(). Remember that you can combine all these operations together with the pipe operator (|>).
```{r}
filter(cereal_data, type =="C") |> group_by(highcal_cold = calories) |> arrange(desc(highcal_cold))
```
